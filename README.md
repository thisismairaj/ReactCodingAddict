# ReactCodingAddict

I am following @CodingAddict's playlist on React 18 with Redux Toolkit.

My name is Mairaj Pirzada. I build websites with WordPress, Java, PHP, JavaScript and have run a freelancing business in the past. 

I have previously tried to learn ReactJS and followed other tutorials, but never truly finished or maintained consistency. This might be my 32nd attempt at learning ReactJS, not because I don't "get" it. I just haven't reached the level of consistency with learning React that I should have.

So let's try again. This time, I will watch tutorials, read documentation, practice my coding on the go, and record it as I go. The videos aren't edited at all, they're "as is" and may sometimes be boring or contain me making silly mistakes.
